This code fetches data about NBA teams and players from the provided API endpoints and performs some data transformations. The goal is to calculate the total combined weight of each NBA team and determine the heaviest and lightest teams.

Extraction:

The NBA team data is obtained by making a GET request to the 'https://www.balldontlie.io/api/v1/teams' endpoint.
The NBA player data is obtained by making a GET request to the 'https://www.balldontlie.io/api/v1/players' endpoint.
Transformation:

The code calculates the total combined weight of each NBA team by iterating over the player data.
For each player, their team ID and weight are extracted.
If the weight value exists, it is added to the corresponding team's total weight.
The transformed data is then converted into a pandas DataFrame with columns 'Team ID' and 'Total Weight'.
Loading:

The code finds the heaviest team by locating the row in the DataFrame with the maximum 'Total Weight' value.
The code finds the lightest team by locating the row in the DataFrame with the minimum 'Total Weight' value.
Finally, the heaviest and lightest team details are printed.
